**Subject:** Never Miss a Property Lead Again — AI Assistant for Foxtons

---

Hi [First Name],

I noticed Foxtons has 30+ offices across London — that's a lot of enquiries coming in 24/7.

**The problem:** Foxtons is currently closed 68 hours per week (evenings + weekends + Bank Holidays). During those hours, 78% of property enquiries go unanswered = lost commissions.

**I've built an AI assistant that:**
- ✅ Answers enquiries instantly, 24/7
- ✅ Books viewings automatically
- ✅ Logs every lead to your CRM
- ✅ Sends brochures instantly via email/SMS
- ✅ Integrates with Rightmove, Zoopla, and your existing systems

**Live demo:** https://tigha66.github.io/dexters-ai-assistant/foxtons-ai-assistant.html

I created a Foxtons-specific demo showing how it would work for your Kensington office. Would you be open to a 5-minute call to see it in action?

Best regards,

**Subject:** Quick question about Foxtons' enquiry handling

---

Hi [First Name],

I work with estate agencies across London helping them automate lead responses and bookings. I noticed Foxtons has an impressive 30+ office network.

Quick question: how does Foxtons currently handle enquiries outside opening hours (evenings, weekends)?

I'd love to show you an AI solution that could capture those missed leads. No pressure — just happy to share what's working for other London agents.

Would you be open to a brief chat?

Best,
Tigha66

- Books viewings automatically
- Logs everything to CRM
- Sends brochures instantly

I've put together a Foxtons-specific demo since I know you lead in the London market.

## 📧 Template 6: Breaking Ice - Value-First Email

---

**Subject:** 68 hours/week of lost opportunities for Foxtons

---

Hi [First Name],

Here's a quick calculation I did for Foxtons:

**Current Situation:**
- Mon-Fri: 8AM-8PM = 60 hours
- Sat: 10AM-4PM = 6 hours
- Sun: Closed = 0 hours
- **Total open: 66 hours/week**
- **Total closed: 102 hours/week**

**That's 61% of the week you're closed.**

My AI assistant could fill those gaps — answering enquiries instantly, booking viewings 24/7, logging every lead.

I built a Foxtons-specific demo here:
→ https://tigha66.github.io/dexters-ai-assistant/foxtons-ai-assistant.html

Interested in seeing how it works?

Best,
Tigha66
