## Lead 1: Solo Consulting Business Owner

**Source:** Reddit r/smallbusiness
**Post:** "How did you reduce admin time as a solo business owner? I'm drowning in repetitive tasks."
**URL:** https://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/1r307db/

**Profile:**
- Solo consulting business owner
- Making ~£8K monthly revenue
- No employees

**Pain Points:**
- Email management: 2 hours daily (client questions, scheduling, follow-ups, invoice reminders)
- Meeting prep and notes: 1.5 hours daily
- Invoicing and follow-ups: 3 hours weekly
- Document management: 2 hours weekly
- Repetitive client questions: 1 hour daily ("What's your pricing?", "How does onboarding work?")

**Current Solutions Tried:**
- Notion (helped but not maintained consistently)
- FreshBooks for invoicing
- Canned email responses (feels too robotic)
- Hiring a VA (too expensive)

**Why AI Solves This:**
An AI chatbot can handle repetitive client questions 24/7, auto-schedule appointments, and send invoice reminders. AI voice can handle call intake.

**Outreach Angle:**
"Hi, I saw your post about admin eating up your time. I help solo consultants like you automate client enquiries, booking, and invoicing — without sounding robotic. Happy to show you how others in your position have reclaimed 10+ hours/week."

## Lead 2: Dermatology Practice Owner

**Source:** Reddit r/smallbusiness
**Post:** "My dermatology practice is growing but I can't afford to hire fast enough. Payroll is eating my margins alive."
**URL:** https://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/1r1nfib/

**Profile:**
- Dermatology practice owner (US-based but relevant UK model)
- 18 months old
- Grown from 12 to 28 patients/day
- 1 front desk + 2 MAs + billing coordinator

**Pain Points:**
- Payroll went from $8K to $22K/month ($30K with benefits)
- Front desk juggling: phones, patient intake, scheduling, referral coordination, prior authorizations
- Things slipping: missed prior auths, phone calls to voicemail, 15-min check-in waits
- Can't afford another front desk person ($38-42K + benefits)

**Why AI Solves This:**
AI voice agent can handle phone intake, scheduling, insurance verification. Chatbot can handle patient enquiries and prior auth status checks. Would reduce need for additional staff.

**Outreach Angle:**
"Congratulations on the growth! I saw you're dealing with the classic growing-pains dilemma — more patients but admin costs spiralling. We help medical practices automate phone handling and patient enquiries. Many have cut admin costs by 40%+ while improving response times. Happy to share examples."

## Lead 3: Small Service Business Owner

**Source:** Reddit r/smallbusiness
**Post:** "Is an AI answering services ok for a small service based business?"
**URL:** https://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/1qv8p7p/

**Profile:**
- Small service business (trades)
- 1 technician + part-time office person
- Busy but missing 90% of calls

**Pain Points:**
- Missing 90% of phone calls
- Texting callers but only 30-40% respond
- Losing 60-70% of missed leads to competitors
- Can't call back fast enough

**Why AI Solves This:**
AI voice answering service can answer 24/7, take messages, offer SMS for quick response, qualify leads before handing to technician.

**Outreach Angle:**
"Those stats are tough — missing 90% of calls and losing 60%+ of leads is painful. We help trades businesses never miss a call. Our AI answers immediately, books jobs, and sends you SMS — so you're not losing leads while with a customer. Want to see how it works?"

## Lead 4: Coffee Shop Owner

**Source:** Reddit r/smallbusiness
**Post:** "running a small business is exhausting"
**URL:** https://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/1r2n7ji/

**Profile:**
- Coffee shop owner (2+ years)
- Staffing, inventory, customer acquisition challenges

**Pain Points:**
- Constant juggling: staffing, inventory, finding customers
- Equipment breakdowns during rush hours
- Endless paperwork ("why is there always so much paperwork?")
- Contemplating quitting

**Why AI Solves This:**
AI can automate ordering/inventory, handle social media DMs, manage bookings (if seating), and handle supplier communications.

**Outreach Angle:**
"Running a coffee shop is tough — I get it. The paperwork and daily fires never stop. I help small hospitality businesses automate the repetitive stuff (social media, bookings, supplier orders). It's not going to fix a broken espresso machine, but it can free up hours every week. Worth a chat?"

## Lead 6: Solo Business Owner on CRM Frustrations

**Source:** Reddit r/smallbusinessuk
**Post:** "Are there any AI tools that have actually helped you significantly?"
**URL:** https://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusinessuk/comments/1qvmp7e/

**Profile:**
- UK small business owner
- Skeptical about AI tools

Our solution is human-in-the-loop AI that handles the repetitive stuff but lets the business owner make the final decisions.

**Outreach Angle:**
"Saw your take on AI tools — agree most are overhyped. The difference with what we do is it's not 'set and forget' — it's AI that handles the repetitive queries and bookings, but you stay in control. We've got several UK small businesses using it. Happy to show you a demo?"
