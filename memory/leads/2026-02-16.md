# Lead Research - February 16, 2026

## Research Attempt Summary

**Platforms Attempted:**
- Twitter/X - Requires authentication/login
- Reddit (r/smallbusiness) - Blocked by CAPTCHA
- LinkedIn - Requires authentication
- Quora - Blocked by Cloudflare protection
- Yell.com - Blocked by Cloudflare protection
- Various UK business news sites - General news only, no specific leads

**Result:** Unable to access social media platforms or business directories due to:

2. Authentication barriers on Twitter, LinkedIn, Reddit
3. Bot protection (Cloudflare/CAPTCHA) on business directories
