# Roto-Rooter Outreach Emails

## 📧 Email 1: Cold Outreach (Best for first contact)

**To:** manager@rotorootermanhattan.com
**Subject:** Never miss another service call

---

Hi,

I help businesses like yours capture every call. Since you advertise "24/7 service," here's the question:

**Who's answering when your team is on a job?**

Our AI receptionist:
- ✅ Answers every call 24/7
- ✅ Books appointments automatically  
- ✅ Sends SMS reminders (60% fewer no-shows)
- ✅ Gathers all details before dispatch

One missed call = ~$200 lost. AI costs $199/mo. Pays for itself in 1 job.

## 📧 Email 2: Follow-up (if no response)

**Subject:** Quick question about your calls

---

Hi,

Just following up on my last email.

Quick question: How many calls do you miss per week from being on a job?

Our AI answers every call, books the job, and sends you the details. No more missed revenue.

Happy to show you a quick demo (free).

Best,
Abdelhaq
