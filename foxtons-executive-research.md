## 💡 Quick Email Template - Tech Focus

**Subject:** AI Automation for Foxtons — Technology Partnership

Hi [Name],

I'm reaching out to technology leaders at major estate agencies about an AI assistant that:

1. Handles property enquiries 24/7
2. Books viewings automatically
3. Integrates with CRM and calendars

I believe Foxtons, as London's most recognized brand, could benefit significantly from this technology.

Would you have 10 minutes for a quick demo?

Best,

Hi [Name],

I help estate agencies automate their enquiry handling and booking systems with AI.

I noticed Foxtons has 30+ offices — that scale makes you an ideal candidate for automation.

Do you have 5 minutes for a quick question about your current technology?

Thanks,
Tigha66
