**Subject:** Never miss another service call

**Body:**
```
Hi [Name],

I help businesses like yours capture every call. Since you advertise 24/7 service, here's the question:

Who's answering when your team is on a job?

Our AI receptionist:
- Answers every call 24/7
- Books appointments automatically
- Sends SMS reminders

One missed call = ~$200 lost. AI costs $199/mo.

### Follow-up
If no response in 3-5 days:
```
Hi [Name],

Just following up. How many calls do you miss per week from being on a job?

Our AI answers every call, books the job, and sends you the details.

Happy to show you a quick demo.

Best,
Abdelhaq
